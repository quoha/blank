This site is a tutorial for the Hugo static web site generator.
Everything is generated from the [source](https://github.com/quoha/blank) stored on GitHub.

Please remember that this site shows how to use Hugo, not how to design a web site.
Hugo can easily generate a responsive website, but this theme is kept simple to avoid distractions.

## Design

The main design for this site comes from the [Origo](http://andreasviklund.com/templates/origo/) theme
by [Andreas Viklund](http://andreasviklund.com/templates/andreas01). Some alternate layouts are taken
from his [Basic Reader](http://andreasviklund.com/templates/basic-reader/) theme.

I use the [HTML5 Reset](http://html5reset.org/) and plan on integrating some of the beautiful typography
from [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/). The articles on changing colors use some of these
[palletes](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/inspiration/beautiful-color-palettes-for-your-next-web-project).

## Thanks

Thanks to everyone on the [Hugo forum](http://discuss.gohugo.io/) for their help in understanding how
Hugo works and how it should be used.
