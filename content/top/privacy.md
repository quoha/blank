My privacy policy is simple: I don't intend to track or sell any information
about you or your browsing history.

My hosting company may log information about visitors, though. They currently
track originating IP address, URL requested, and the time of the request. Logs
are stored on their servers and in their backups for an unknown length of time.

The primary purpose of these logs is to track usage and to monitor for attempts
at exploiting the system.

If you find this logging troublesome, please don't use this site.

## Future Plans

I intend to use Google Analytics in the future. I also intend to integrate
some social media tools such as Discourse, Facebook, and Twitter. When I do,
I will update this page.

The purpose of these changes is to learn how to integrate the tools with Hugo
and then to teach others to do the same.
