blank
=====

Blank pulls what I think are the best practices from the [Hugo](http://discuss.gohugo.io/latest) discussion list. Of course my picks are arbitrary and opinionated but they should give you a sense of what can be done.

Blank is a bit more than a theme. It's a complete sample, it's an introduction, it's best practices. All that and less. Blank purposely minimizes the styling. If you can use this as a starting point for your layout, then this project is a success.

Blank is inspired by the work of the [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-Wordpress-Theme) team.
